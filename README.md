# Hello, I'm Patricio Palacios ðŸ‘‹

I have a **Master Degree** with extensive experience in the field of structural civil engineering. Currently, I'm a Professor at the **Pontifica Universidad Catolica del Ecuador (PUCE)** and at the **Escuela de Arquitectura de la UNiverisdad Internacional del Ecuador (UIDE)**.

I graduated as a **Master in Research in Civil Engineering** with a mention in Structures from the **Univerisdad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE**. My research focuses on seismic threat for continental Ecuador, developing models of seismic intensities.

As a consultant, I've worked on the calculation and structural design of large-scale projects in the Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, specializing in the non-linearity of structures for essential and special buildings in reinforced concrete. I've been a consultant for the **Ministerio de Cultura y Patrimonioe**, design leader for the **Empresa ElÃ©ctrica Quito** in the infrastructure area, and structural analyst at the former **SECOB**.

I'm a speaker at national and international seminars, reviewer, and writer of scientific articles. I specialize in workflow through the **BIM** methodology.

I actively participate in the update committee of the Ecuadorian construction code **NEC15** in the chapter "Seismic Hazard and Seismoresistant Design" and the chapter "Seismic Evaluation and Structural Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings".

## ðŸŒ± I'm currently investigating...

I continue to update myself on the latest trends and technologies in civil engineering and architecture.
