# Hello, I'm Patricio Palacios ðŸ‘‹

I have a **Master's Degree** with extensive experience in the field of Structural Civil Engineering. Currently, I'm a Professor at the [**Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador (PUCE)**](https://www.puce.edu.ec/) and at the [**Escuela de Arquitectura de la Univerisdad Internacional del Ecuador (UIDE)**](https://www.uide.edu.ec/).

I graduated as a **Master in Research in Structural Civil Engineering** from the **Univerisdad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE**. My research focuses on seismic threat for continental Ecuador, developing models of seismic intensities.

As a consultant, I've worked on the calculation and structural design of large-scale projects in Quito, ECU specializing in the non-linearity of structures for essential and special buildings in reinforced concrete. I've been a consultant for the **Ministerio de Cultura y Patrimonio**, design leader for the **Empresa Electrica Quito** in the infrastructure area, and structural analyst at the former **SECOB**. Currently I am the **CEO** at my Consultant Company [**JEP Engineering**](https://www.jepengineering.com/)

I have participated as a speaker at national and international seminars, reviewer, and writer of scientific articles. I specialize in workflow through the **BIM** methodology.

I actively participate in the update committee of the Ecuadorian Construction Building Code **NEC15** in the chapter "Seismic Hazard and Seismoresistant Design" and the chapter "Seismic Evaluation and Structural Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings".

## ðŸŒ± I'm currently investigating...

I continue to update myself on the latest trends and technologies in Civil Engineering and Architecture.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me?

You can contact me through my email (Visiti my Consultant Company web page), or send me a direct message here on GitHub.
